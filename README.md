The part #18 of Advent of JS2021

The text input field should automatically update as the range field changes or one of the items is checked

The user can click on the copy icon to the right of the input field to copy the password to their clipboard.

When a user clicks on the copy icon, a class of "copied" should be added to the button. This will display the word "Copied" and change the text color to green.

After 5 seconds, the "copied" class should be removed from the button.

The range slider should allow the user to change the password length. The minimum amount is 6 and the max is 32 (limits are imposed through the HTML element)

Checking symbols will allow symbols to be used in the password

Checking numbers will allow numbers to be used in the password

Checking lowercase letters will allow lowercase letters to be used in the password

Checking uppercase letters will allow uppercase letters to be used in the password

Checking include similar letters will allow similar letters from the password (i, l, 1, L, o, 0, O)
